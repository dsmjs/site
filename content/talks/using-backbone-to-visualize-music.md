For this talk, I'm thinking Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger -- using
Backbone to visualize music. I'll demonstrate how to use routers,
models, and views to do some cool stuff -- like making a media player
that can pick up where you left off, visualize the music to which you
are listening, and manage a music library -- ya know, non-crud stuff.
