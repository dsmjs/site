HTML5 is progressing fast, and so is the performance of mobile devices. However
it is still a challenge to build ‘native’ like UI with HTML and JavaScript on
mobile.

The topic of discussion will be around using a brand new virtualized scrolling
component as a case study. This ScrollList component is intended to provide
near-native performance for huge amounts of content in an application built
entirely on HTML5 and JavaScript.

This ScrollList component is the first component to be released as part of Web
UIComponents - a library developed internally at WebFilings, but now being
released as an Open Source project.
