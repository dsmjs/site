Sailsjs is great for creating awesome backend applications. Its very quick to
stand up an endpoint and fly forward. However, what if you wanted to use it as
your presentation platform (like Revealjs)? This talk is focused around the
flexibility that Sailjs provides itâ€™s users.

Fueled by silliness and coffee Chuck tries to create efficiency in everything
he and others do. His specialties are Front-end development, architecture,
continuous integration, and bringing much needed innovation to enterprises. He
absolutely love technology, and spends a vast majority of his time learning
about it or teaching it.
