The Chrome developer tools are essential for problem solving but often the
intermediate/ advanced features aren't widely known. Over the last 18 months
I've run into 3 situations that I'd like to share with the community.

1. Finding Swallowed exceptions
1. Attaching local devtools to remote headless chrome
1. Using devtools to debug nodeJS

Join me for a session of hands-on and practical javascript debugging!
