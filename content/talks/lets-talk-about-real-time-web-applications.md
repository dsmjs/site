In this 25 minute run down we will delve into the socket.io library and how you
can get up and running with it in minutes.  The server / client relationship
will be demystified, we will squash the optimistic rendering paradigm, and
chances are you will be ready to implement your own chat room protocol that's
on par with IRC.

Okay so maybe that may be a bit ambitious, but i've been playing with socket.io
a lot lately and i'd like to share my experiences with my favorite community in
Des Moines!

Who knows, you may even get some JS related stickers just for showing up!
