From the React docs to Formidable’s home page to seemingly everything in
between, the “ludicrously fast” static site generator Gatsby is the engine
powering a growing percentage of statically generated sites. This talk goes
into the details of what Gatsby is, what static site generation really is, and
how each of us armed with this combo can make performant, dynamic, and truly
great static sites and performant web applications with the incredibly powerful
combination of Gatsby, React, and static site generation.
