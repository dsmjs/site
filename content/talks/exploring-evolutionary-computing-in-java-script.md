As a web developer, you find a rhythm of building backend and front-end services
to accomplish a goal.  You can get lost in the trees of frameworks, methodologies,
and patterns centric to the web and miss the forest of computer science.  This
was my realization when I first learned about Evolutionary Computing, the idea
that computers could produce meaningful results by mimicking biology was a
fascinating paradigm shift.

This talk is the story of my journey in understanding EC through JavaScript.  I
am no expert on the topic, but I can demonstrate EC's basic mechanics.  Coding
for a new paradigm as reinvigorated my passion for code and I hope it has the
same effect for those in attendance.
