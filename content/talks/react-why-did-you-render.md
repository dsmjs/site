You've probably heard that React is performant. You may have also heard about React's smart diffing algorithm and how it intelligently updates the DOM to avoid unnecessary work. This is awesome, right? Well, yes, but you might not be getting the performance you think you are by default. As a teaser, by default React re-renders everything.. all the time.

In this talk, I'll demo some surprises we have dealt with in production applications. We'll then go over some out-of-the-box (i.e., with Chrome) tools you can use to figure out why things aren't working as you'd expect.

Parking is available in the lot to the south of the building as well as along the street. The meeting will be in the Gain Compliance office on the third floor.
