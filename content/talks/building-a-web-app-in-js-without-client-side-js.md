Today, building web apps tends to involve a myriad of frameworks and libraries
with many of them being shipped across the internet to be downloaded, parsed,
compiled, and executed to deliver a web app experience.  Not long ago, the web
didn't rely on client-side frameworks.  What did that look like?  What patterns
were used? I'll show you how to build a web app with only native APIs and
without client-side JavaScript to demonstrate a different approach to building
fast applications and explore patterns that are used heavily outside the
JavaScript community.
