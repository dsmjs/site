A style guide or component-library has the potential to be huge help in keeping
your engineering teams up to date on the latest intended design details. Over
time however, it ultimately severely diverges from the production
implementation and ends up resulting in finger-pointing between the design and
engineering organizations.

Sharing the implementation of the front-end components between the production
application and the component-library demo and prototype(s) prevents the
inevitable divergence and keeps all parties aware of the impacts of desired
changes. This talk will highlight component-library tools and collaboration
techniques, with an emphasis on leveraging npm to share the component
implementation.
