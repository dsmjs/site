(intermediate ImpactJS)

Joel will be giving a Part II version of his [DSM Webgeeks lunch presentation](http://www.dsmwebgeeks.com/2013/04/javascript-game-development-%E2%80%93-lunch-meeting-wed-april-17th/)
(April 17th) on Javascript Game Development and will build on some of the basic
concepts he demonstrated.  He will be modeling much of the talk after the
Introducing HTML5 Game Development book by Jesse Freeman and will introduce
concepts such as:

* Gravity / Friction
* Collision Objects
* Player vs. Enemy entities

If there is time and interest he will also demonstrate how to package an
ImpactJS game to run native on an iOS device - while not writing ANY
Objective-C.
