I've become more interested in functional programming this year but didn't know how exactly I could bring that experience to ember. After a few hours cargo culting the react-redux api it was clear I had something that would forever change the way I wrote ember web applications. Join me for a live coding demo where I bring the mythical "functional core, imperative shell" concept to reality!
