Have you ever wanted to run a single unit test while you do test driven development in javascript? Are you using Karma and QUnit? During this talk I'll show how to add a plugin to the default karma test runner that lets you get fast feedback as you build your application test-first. This talk will be a basic intro to the plugin/karma/qunit and should be under 15 minutes.
