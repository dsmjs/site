Facebook's Instant Messenger Games are fun HTML5/Javascript games that anyone on messenger can play and build. They are quickly gaining popularity, but many of the developers are missing the mark when it comes to securing their game system. I have discovered a way to 'hack' the stats of many free games due to poor architecture and security considerations from one developer. I'll take you through a few hacks on one of my favorite time killers, Everwing. Free Gems, Trophies, Dragons and more are possible once you understand how the user state is built and transmitted in this game. I hope this demonstration will shed light on potential security pitfalls your javascript applications may have.
