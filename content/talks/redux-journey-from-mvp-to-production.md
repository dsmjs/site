After inheriting a minimially viable product I was tasked with adding
production maturity to our front end application. I'll be discussing an intro
to Redux concepts and touching on multiple patterns and packages that helped
propel our miniamally viable product into a much more mature platform.

## Parking

In garage (Entrance on locust toward 8th) or on street.
If parking in the 700 Locust St. Garrage take the elevator to street level then
you will have to walk out of the exit and walk 3/4 block back toward 8th street
(west) along Locust street to gain access to the Space2Work street entrance.
