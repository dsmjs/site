Come checkout how I code my React/Redux projects. I'll be going over the
architecture, project organization, libraries, and common patterns that I use
to build developer friendly, scalable, reusable, and organized projects.
Tutorials out there are great for learning React/Redux and small applications,
but I'm going to dig deeper to show you how to create code that will last.
(Some React/Redux experience is encouraged).

_Note:_ to find Suite 604W, take the elevators up to the 6th floor and take a
right and look for signs for [Trility Consulting](https://trility.io/).
