The biggest challenge adopting test driven development is knowing when to write
a unit test and/or integration test as you write new features or fix production
bugs. During this short talk I'll test drive adding a new feature using both
unit and integration tests. The focus of this talk is the inner dialog I have
along the way (asking myself when each type of test is valuable and why).
