Advances in JavaScript cryptography have resulted in several libraries made
available that can perform client side encryption.  We’ll look at two of the
most common, SJCL and CryptoJS, along with the WebCrypto API that the W3C is
currently drafting.  Finally, we’ll look at the practical applications and
pitfalls of using client side encryption and discuss real world use cases.
