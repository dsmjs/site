Is your SPA was easily indexable, [Fast](https://blog.twitter.com/2012/improving-performance-on-twittercom),
maintainable?  I will show how to server side render any initial request into a
SPA with [hapi](http://hapijs.com/) and [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/),
and then client side render any following requests.  Write your views in React
once and don't worry where they render.
