Haven’t had a chance to dig into Angular2 yet? Waiting until it “stabilizes” before spending your time to learn it? Tried out some of the “Quick Starts” only to find out they weren’t so quick? You’re not alone.

In this session, I will show you the basics of the newest version of AngularJS, the differences from Angular 1.x, and even show you the Angular-CLI which makes it drop-dead simple to get (and keep) an organized Angular2 project underway. I will even show you where Angular2 doesn’t shine so bright. You will leave with a better understanding of Angular2 and the knowledge to get started on the right path with the newest version of AngularJS!
