Part of JavaScript’s charm and elegance stems from the fact that it works quite
a bit differently than most other languages. The “this” keyword is one of the
parts of JavaScript that seems to behave perhaps a bit differently than what
might be expected. In addition to the “this” keyword, I will discuss execution
contexts, the “new” operator, the call, apply and bind functions, and strict
mode.
