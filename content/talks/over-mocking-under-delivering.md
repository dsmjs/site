The JavaScript community has a strong testing culture, but advanced topics like
the intersection of integration and isolation testing can be as confusing as
they are controversial. To make matters worse we are often tricked into
believing that a mock library has the answer to all of our problems, making it
difficult to evaluate when to use mocks (or even avoid them).

This talk will give you a fresh perspective on the use and abuse of mock
objects, explore why this topic is crucial for test suite reliability, and
equip developers with strategies to make these distinctions without the
guesswork.
