Do you want to use the next generation of javascript modules today? Join me for
a live coding session where I show how to write es6 modules and transpile them
to AMD. Specifically I'll be showing off the es6-module-transpiler. If we have
time I'll also show a bower demo where you can install and import modules on
demand without having to worry about order dependent scripts (even for scripts
with nested dependencies).
