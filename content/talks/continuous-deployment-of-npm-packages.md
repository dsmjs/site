# Location Change

We are going to be at the <strong>NEW</strong> Gravitate location at:
[317 6th Avenue, Suite 102 Des Moines](https://www.google.com/maps/place/317+6th+Ave+%23102,+Des+Moines,+IA+50309/@41.586651,-93.6266667,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x87ee99010087166f:0xa5ac4756076468ed!8m2!3d41.586651!4d-93.624478).
As of now, parking is on the street.

Keeping up with the fast-paced releases of node packages can be overwhelming. A
project is often left with the choice of wasting many hours simply bumping
package versions or letting their long list of dependencies get further and
further out of date. With so much talk of JS fatigue, it can be hard to believe
that the same community has also produced many tools that can actually make
your life easier in ways that are unmatched in other tech stacks.

This talk will focus on the use of a combination of available OSS tools that
can help to automate away some of the most tedious tasks of maintaining a
JavaScript project. Continuous deployment is a lofty goal for applications,
but we will even discuss continuous-deployment for internal packages.
